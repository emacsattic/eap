* Custom definitions

* Secondary music directory (and playlist directory)

    This would be useful in a case (such as mine) where my main music
    directory is on a removable drive that I can't always be bothered
    to switch on.  EAP should use secondary directories if primary
    directories are't found.

* Make column widths in playlist buffer customisable

* Scrobble song information to Last.FM
