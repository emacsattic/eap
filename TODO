* Secondary music directory (and playlist directory)

 This would be useful in a case (such as mine) where my main music
 directory is on a removable drive that I can't always be bothered to
 switch on.  EAP should use secondary directories if primary
 directories aren't found.

* Make column widths in playlist buffer customisable

 My development machine accomodates about 120 columns in a full-width
 buffer (and using a medium-sized font) so the column widths I've
 chosen reflect that value.  Better (but harder) than making the
 column widths user-configurable, would be some 'smart sizing'
 routines, reflecting the number of columns available in any given
 buffer.

* Scrobble song information to Last.FM

 Scrobbling song information to http://last.fm.  Don't even know where
 to begin on this one.
