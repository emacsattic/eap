<p>This manual (last modified: &lt;15/01/2009 18:18:29 UTC&gt;) documents Emacs' AlsaPlayer version 0.12
(Gaza Remembered), an Emacs interface to the <a href="http://www.alsaplayer.org">AlsaPlayer</a> PCM audio player.

   <p>Emacs' AlsaPlayer is referred to as <dfn>EAP</dfn> (pronounced 'eep') throughout the rest of
this manual.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Music Without Jolts</h2>

<p>What is a 'jolt' exactly?  According to the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/webster/">GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English</a>, to jolt someone is:
<blockquote>
To stun or shock or change the mental state of a person suddenly, as if with a blow; as,
the sight of the house on fire jolted him into action; his mother's early death jolted
his idyllic happiness. [PJC]
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">So there we have it.

   <p>Imagine, if you will, that you are listening to the elegiac, yet somehow uplifting title
track of the album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_to_Roam">'Room To Roam'</a> by
British folk rock band <a href="http://mikescottwaterboys.com">The Waterboys</a>, and decide
that it doesn't quite suit your mood at that particular moment in time.  What do you do? 
Well, let's say you tell your audio player to skip forward to the next song in the
current playlist.  Now imagine that your audio player is in what's commonly known as
'shuffle mode' and the next song happens to be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_War">'War On War'</a> by American alt country band
<a href="http://wilcoworld.net">Wilco</a>.  Unless sufficient care is taken (and EAP is the
only audio player I know of that takes sufficient care), you will undoubtedly endure a
significant jolt to your idyllic happiness.

   <p>In short, listen to your music with EAP (with all volume related settings at their
default values) and <em>anything you do</em> that would ordinarily result in an abrupt
change of volume is preceeded by a gentle volume fade, ensuring that jolts to your
idyllic happiness are a thing of the past (power cuts excepted).

   <p>Finally, your personal idyllic happiness is part of a wider struggle, namely that of
trying to rid our environment of jolts <em>entirely</em>.  For most people, Vim is the once
popular scouring powder produced by Lever Brothers from 1904 to 1993 and reputedly used
by Francis Bacon as a substitute for toothpaste, but for a very few people it is a
program that can be used for editing text.

   <p>If someone offers you Vim (the program) or makes Vim (the program) available to you in
any way, <strong>do not accept it!</strong>  Every attempt to extend Vim (the program) so that it
performs adequately as a jolt-eliminating music player has resulted in total and
unmitigated failure and each time someone adopts Vim (the program) as their editor of
choice the struggle to rid our environment of jolts suffers a significant, demoralising
setback; significant because it defeats our stated aim, and demoralising because users of
Vim (the program) often develop a strange, irrational loyalty to it, accompanied by an
equally unfathomable prejudice towards Emacs.  When that happens we have what can only be
described as an immovable jolt to contend with.

   <p>Persuading users of Vim (the program) to switch to Emacs for the sake of the environment,
<em>and not for any other reason</em>, has been known to work in a few well known (though
poorly documented) cases.

<p><a name="Feature-list"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Feature list</h2>

     <ul>
<li>Music Without Jolts.  See <a href="#Music-Without-Jolts">Music Without Jolts</a>.

     <li>Easily enqueue songs from dired buffers.  See <a href="#Starting-Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer">Starting Emacs' AlsaPlayer</a>.

     <li>Easily replace current playlist from dired buffers.  See <a href="#Starting-Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer">Starting Emacs' AlsaPlayer</a>.

     <li>Optionally enqueue/replace songs in a random order (shuffle mode).  See <a href="#Starting-Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer">Starting Emacs' AlsaPlayer</a>.

     <li>Global control of all common music player actions (pause, previous, next, jump e.t.c)
from anywhere in Emacs, i.e., no need to switch buffers.  See <a href="#Playlist_002fsong-position-commands">Playlist/song position commands</a>.

     <li>Easily add the current song to a named playlist from anywhere (no need to switch
buffers).  See <a href="#Other-commands">Other commands</a>.

     <li>Unlimited named playlists, implemented as directories of symbolic links (which is good
for other purposes, such as burning CDs).

<p><a name="Brief-technical-overview"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Brief technical overview</h2>

<p>EAP is an Emacs interface to <a href="http://alsaplayer.org">AlsaPlayer</a>:

     <dl>
<dt>AlsaPlayer<dd>The following description is taken from the AlsaPlayer website (to which a link is
provided above):
<blockquote>
AlsaPlayer is a new type of PCM player. It is heavily multi-threaded and tries to
excercise the ALSA library and driver quite a bit. It has some very interesting features
unique to *nix players. The goal is to create a fully pluggable framework for playback of
all sorts of media with the focus on PCM audio data. 
</blockquote>

     <p>Despite the name, AlsaPlayer supports a wide array of different audio output interfaces,
including the one-time GNU/Linux default output interface; OSS.  Other output interfaces
supported include Esound, NAS, Sparc, SGI and <a href="http://jack-audio.org">JACK</a>.

     <br><dt>Emacs' AlsaPlayer<dd>EAP manages calls to AlsaPlayer via Emacs' synchronous process routines and two new key
bindings in Dired buffers provide the interface between your music library and
AlsaPlayer.  Named playlists are simply directories of symbolic links and a third Dired
key binding is provided to facilitate the easy addition of symbolic links to these
directories.

   </dl>

<!-- ################################ node ################################ -->
<p><a name="Installation"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Installation</h2>

<p>EAP is an Emacs interface to <a href="http://www.alsaplayer.org">AlsaPlayer</a> so, not
surprisingly, it won't work without it.

<!-- ################################ node ################################ -->
<p><a name="Installing-AlsaPlayer"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Installing AlsaPlayer</h3>

<p>On a Debian GNU/Linux system a minimal working AlsaPlayer requires that these two
packages:

<pre class="example">     alsaplayer-common
     alsaplayer-text
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and one of these:

<pre class="example">     alsaplayer-alsa
     alsaplayer-esd
     alsaplayer-jack
     alsaplayer-nas
     alsaplayer-oss
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">be installed.

   <p>Choose the last package according to your audio output interface.  AlsaPlayer is designed
to work closely with the <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a> system <em>when it's
available</em>, i.e., it works perfectly well without it.

   <p>Test the text interface by issuing the command:

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alsaplayer -i text some-audio-file.ogg</span></samp>&rsquo;

<!-- ################################ node ################################ -->
<p><a name="Installing-Emacs'-AlsaPlayer"></a>
<a name="Installing-Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.2 Installing Emacs' AlsaPlayer</h3>

<p>EAP consists of three separate files; <samp><span class="file">eap.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">eap-dired-keybindings.el</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">eap-autoloads.el</span></samp>.  Ensure that all three files are located somehwere in your
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">load-path</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example, put them in the directory <samp><span class="file">~/elisp</span></samp> and then add
this line to your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")
</pre>
   <p>Next you must tell EAP the location of your music library, and where you would like to
keep your playlists.  For example, add these lines to your ~/.emacs:

<pre class="example">     (setq eap-music-library
           "~/my-music-library" ;default value "~/Music"
     
           eap-playlist-library
           "~/eap-playlists") ;default value "~/eap-playlist-library"
</pre>
   <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Don't make your playlist library a sub-directory of your music
library!

   <p>EAP will create both directories for you if they don't exist.  On the other hand, if you
are happy with the default locations you needn't add these lines to your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>
file at all.

   <p>Finally, either add the line:

<pre class="example">     (require 'eap-autoloads) ;recommended on principle
</pre>
   <p>or

<pre class="example">     (require 'eap)
</pre>
   <p>to your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file.

   <p>The first form defers loading of the package until you actually need it.  The second form
will causes the package to be loaded at start time every time.

   <p>Save your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file and restart Emacs, or issue the command:

   <p><kbd>M-x load-file RET ~/.emacs RET</kbd>.

<!-- ################################ node ################################ -->
<p><a name="Starting-Emacs'-AlsaPlayer"></a>
<a name="Starting-Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">6 Starting Emacs' AlsaPlayer</h2>

<p>EAP can be started by issuing the command <kbd>M-x eap</kbd> from anywhere within Emacs.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x eap</kbd><dd>First of all, a note about how AlsaPlayer behaves.  When AlsaPlayer exits cleanly it
writes its current playlist to a playlist file (usually
<samp><span class="file">~/.alsaplayer/alsaplayer.m3u</span></samp>).

     <p>Assuming EAP is not already running, when you issue the command <kbd>M-x eap</kbd> EAP
checks for the presence of this playlist file and if it is found (and has non-zero
length) EAP will ask you if you'd like to continue where you left off.  Answer positively
and EAP will create a playlist from the contents of this file and proceed to play it.  If
the file is not found (or is of zero length) your music library is displayed in Dired.

     <p>If EAP is running when you issue the command <kbd>M-x eap</kbd> the EAP buffer (default
name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP*</span></samp>&rsquo;) is displayed. 
</dl>

   <p>EAP may also be started via one of the three Dired keybindings, all of which can be
performed on a single file, a set of marked files, a single directory, or a set of marked
directories.  I refer to these simply as <dfn>marked</dfn> below.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-p p</kbd><dd>Start a new playlist consisting of marked.  Use a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>) to shuffle
marked in the new playlist.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-p q</kbd><dd>Add marked to the current playlist (a.k.a enqueuing).  Use a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>)
to shuffle marked before they are added.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-p s</kbd><dd>Add marked to named playlist.  This command will not start AlsaPlayer or have any effect
on the current playlist if AlsaPlayer is already running. 
</dl>

<p><a name="Emacs'-AlsaPlayer-Buffers"></a>
<a name="Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer-Buffers"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">7 Emacs' AlsaPlayer Buffers</h2>

<p>There are two Emacs' AlsaPlayer buffers, called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP Playlist*</span></samp>&rsquo; by
default, although these names are customisable.  See <a href="#Customising-Emacs_0027-AlsaPlayer">Customising Emacs' AlsaPlayer</a>.

   <p>Exactly the same commands are available in each buffer.  See <a href="#Keys-and-commands">Keys and commands</a>.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP*</span></samp>&rsquo; is only supposed to be two lines tall, and displays the AlsaPlayer
process output.  It is not designed to be killed (<kbd>C-x k</kbd>).  Doing so kills the
AlsaPlayer process very abruptly, not allowing it time to save the current playlist to
disk.  The correct way to stop listening to music is to type <kbd>Q</kbd>, in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer, or <kbd>M-x apq</kbd>, from anywhere within Emacs.

     <p>If you find killing buffers a hard habit to break you can ensure that AlsaPlayer always
quits cleanly (and saves your current playlist) by adding the function
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">eap-always-kill-buffer-cleanly</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">kill-buffer-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This isn't as hard as
it sounds.  Simply add the following lines to your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook
                    'eap-always-kill-buffer-cleanly)
</pre>
     <p>The same precaution can be taken when killing your Emacs session by adding the function
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">eap-always-kill-emacs-cleanly</span></samp>&rsquo; to the list &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">kill-emacs-query-functions</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Simply add these lines to your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> as well:

     <pre class="example">          (add-to-list 'kill-emacs-query-functions
                       'eap-always-kill-emacs-cleanly)
</pre>
     <p><strong>N.B.</strong> If EAP is doing its best to avoid jolts to your idyllic happiness
(see <a href="#Music-Without-Jolts">Music Without Jolts</a>), which it does by default, then adding these hooks will add
two or three seconds to each operation.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP Playlist*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP Playlist*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer displays the contents of the current playlist, with the
currently playing song highlighted.  This buffer is not self-refreshing so you may
occasionally need to type <kbd>p</kbd> to update it.

   </dl>

<!-- ################################ node ################################ -->
<p><a name="Keys-and-commands"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">8 Keys and commands</h2>

<p>The same set of key commands listed below are available in both EAP buffers; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*EAP*</span></samp>&rsquo;

<h2 class="chapter">11 TODOs</h2>

     <dl>
<dt>Secondary music directory (and playlist directory)<dd>This would be useful in a case (such as mine) where my main music directory is on a
removable drive that I can't always be bothered to switch on.  EAP should use secondary
directories if primary directories aren't found.

     <br><dt>Make column widths in playlist buffer customisable<dd>
My development machine accomodates about 120 columns in a full-width buffer (and using a
medium-sized font) so the column widths I've chosen reflect that value.  Better (but
harder) than making the column widths user-configurable, would be some 'smart sizing'
routines, reflecting the number of columns available in any given buffer.

     <br><dt>Scrobble song information to Last.FM<dd>
Scrobbling song information to http://last.fm.  Don't really know where to begin on this
one.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Known bugs and limitations</h2>

<p>If volume fade-out functionality is enabled and you pause playback (<kbd>SPC</kbd> in an EAP
buffer or <kbd>M-x ap.</kbd> from anywhere), followed immediately by a command to skip to the
next song in the current playlist (<kbd>&gt; or [right]</kbd> in an EAP buffer or <kbd>M-x ap&gt;</kbd>
from anywhere), the volume is not properly restored.  Typing <kbd>=</kbd> in an EAP buffer, or
<kbd>M-x ap=</kbd> from anywhere, usually corrects this situation.

   <p>Failure to properly restore the volume after a fade-out has been observed in other less
easily identifiable situations, but these occasions are thankfully few.  If it does
happen to you, the same fix (described above) applies.

<h2 class="chapter">13 Possibly asked questions</h2>

     <dl>
<dt>Does AlsaPlayer play Ogg Vorbis files?<dd>The question should really be, does AlsaPlayer play mp3 files?  I didn't write AlsaPlayer
(only the Emacs interface), but I happen to know that it takes a pretty dim view of
always playing mp3s.  Even if you only <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/playogg.html">play oggs</a> occasionally you'll be surprised how much you go up in its estimation.

     <br><dt>Why commit yourself to one particular back-end?<dd>I like Alsplayer.  I like the fact that the designers thought to include a text interface
(no GUI) and it's command line interface is especiialy clean and simple.

     <p>People are welcome to implement support for other players but the name, Emacs'
AlsaPlayer, is here to stay.
