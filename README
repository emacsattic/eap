Greetings fellow Emacs user.

Everything you need to know (including how to install EAP) is in the manual:

 eap.html - manual in HTML format
 eap.info - manual in Info format
  eap.txt - manual in plain text format
 eap.texi - manual Texinfo source (please provide patches against this)

The remaining three .el files are the program.

 eap.el
 eap-autoloads.el
 eap-dired-keybindings.el

Quick installation instructions for the impatient
=================================================
(copied verbatim from the manual)

On a Debian GNU/Linux system a minimal working AlsaPlayer requires that
these two packages:

     alsaplayer-common
     alsaplayer-text

and one of these:

     alsaplayer-alsa
     alsaplayer-esd
     alsaplayer-jack
     alsaplayer-nas
     alsaplayer-oss

be installed.

   Choose the last package according to your audio output interface.
AlsaPlayer is designed to work closely with the ALSA
(http://www.alsa-project.org) system _when it's available_, i.e., it
works perfectly well without it.

   Test the text interface by issuing the command:

   `alsaplayer -i text some-audio-file.ogg'

EAP consists of three separate files; `eap.el',
`eap-dired-keybindings.el' and `eap-autoloads.el'.  Ensure that all
three files are located somehwere in your `load-path'.  For example,
put them in the directory `~/elisp' and then add this line to your
`~/.emacs':

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

   Next you must tell EAP the location of your music library, and where
you would like to keep your playlists.  For example, add these lines to
your ~/.emacs:

     (setq eap-music-library
           "~/my-music-library" ;default value "~/Music"

           eap-playlist-library
           "~/eap-playlists") ;default value "~/eap-playlist-library"

   *Important note:* Don't make your playlist library a sub-directory
of your music library!

   EAP will create both directories for you if they don't exist.  On
the other hand, if you are happy with the default locations you needn't
add these lines to your `~/.emacs' file at all.

   Finally, either add the line:

     (require 'eap-autoloads) ;recommended on principle

   or

     (require 'eap)

   to your `~/.emacs' file.

   The first form defers loading of the package until you actually need
it.  The second form will causes the package to be loaded at start time
every time.

   Save your `~/.emacs' file and restart Emacs, or issue the command:

   `M-x load-file RET ~/.emacs RET'.



Happy listening (and hacking)!
